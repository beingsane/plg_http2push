PLG_HTTP2PUSH_DESCRIPTION="HTTP/2 Server Push intercepts Joomla's HTTP response body on each page load to generate a <code>Link</code> header that contains preloading information for remote resources. A size limit of approximately 8 KiB is imposed on the <code>Link</code> header to avoid issues with header size limitations."
